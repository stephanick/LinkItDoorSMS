# LinkItDoorSMS
Arduino code for the LinkIt platform to detect an open door and send an SMS

After posting this, another user took this project a little further.  Here are his comments and link to his repository:

Hey there, I'm yet another doing the same thing. I've written a fairly complete sketch which you could use 
just by setting the "state" variable to 1 based on your threshold. It takes SMS commands to turn off; on; 
change access code; or change, delete or add up to 2 notification numbers. Help 
is "1111 ?" (before you change the default access code, of course). Anyway, it seems to cover 
a lot of your wish list. Just add the GPS antenna.
